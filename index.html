					<p>I'm currently a Software Systems student at Simon Fraser University hoping to one day make it to the big tech world and become a software developer. I thrive to learn and push my self to be better everyday and I hope that my passion for coding continues to grow and motivate me as the years go by. </p>

					<p>As of right now, I haven't decided what would like to specialize in because I still would like to explore my options and what find something I'm passionate about. Some of the things that interest me most are databases, embedded systems, network communication and security systems.</p>

					<p>I consider myself as a passionate, hardworking leader and someone who is able to teach others whilst learning. I'm also flexible in terms of working by myself or as a team. I love working on projects that greatly interest me, as it helps me continously stay motivated and complete projects. One day, I hope to lead a great team of developers to pursue and create great innovations that will hopefully be of great use for others.</p>

				<p>Aside from programming, I enjoy playing sports and staying active, whether that be through basketball, football, hiking or anything physical! I've been apart of many sports teams in different roles, from coaching to playing and have gained a lot of knowledge in becoming an efficient leader as well as a team player. </p>

					<h3>Sports</h3>
					<p>Throughout highschool, I've been involved in a lot of sports teams and tournaments. I enjoy the physical, strategic, and competitive aspects of it.

The thrill and excitement of watching the NFL and NBA is something I look forward to.</p>

					<h3>Hiking</h3>
					<p>The trip up may never be pleasant, but the view is always rewarding. One of my most favourite places that I've hiked at was Joffre Lake, the view, the lakes, the atmosphere were surreal and was definitely an enjoyful trip.</p>
