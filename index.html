					<p>I am a current student at Simon Fraser University taking Software Systems hoping to one day make it to the big tech world and become a software developer. Everyday, I thrive to learn and push my self to be better. I've always been eager to learn and I hope that my passion for coding will continue to grow and motivate me as the years go by, aside from programming, I also enjoy sports such as Basketball and Football. I love being active whether it be running, hiking or anything physical!</p>

					<p>As of right now, I have currently certain point of focus on what I specialize in because I want to be broad and learn a variety of things. Some of the things that interest me most are databases, embedded systems, network communications and security systems</p>

					<p>I consider myself as a leader and always had the skills to lead and teach others. One day, I hope to lead a great team of developers to pursue and create great innovations that will hopefully be of great use for others.</p>
